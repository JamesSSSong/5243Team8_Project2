# Project 2 : Web Application Development and Deployment

## Project Overview

For this project, we created a web application using _R Shiny_. The
application is capable of performing various functions, including
_dataset uploading, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis (EDA)_. Users can interactively explore and analyze data.

## GitHub Files
* The `web_dev.R` file includes coding for data preprocessing (Done by Ruoshi Zhang).
* The `app_yi` file adds code for feature engineering based on the materials from `web_dev.R` (Done by Yi Lu).
* The `web_development_re.R` file adds code for EDA based based on materials from the previous files (Done by Dailin Song).
* Please refer to **`...`** for final version of the web application.
